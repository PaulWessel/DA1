## Building the book PDF from sources
In order to build the DA1 book from source you will need some prerequisites.
The exact installation will depend on your operating system.

0. A UNIX or UNIX-like operating system or shell to understand Makefiles
1. A recent GMT installation 6.x or higher (www.generic-mapping-tools.org)
2. The latex/pdflatex packages (TexLive or similar)

If you have all prerequisites then you can build ERTH_DA1_book.pdf by typing

	make book

If you get errors it is probably related to missing prerequisite tools and libraries,
missing Latex styles or include files, etc.  Expect to do some forensic work.

## Instructor solution set:

Instructors may wish to get a copy of the solution set by sending an email to
earth-DA-book@soest.hawaii.edu with evidence that you are a regular faculty
at a college or university(unless we know you of course).
